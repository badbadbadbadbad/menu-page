However, as we're still here, there must be an error in our calculations. Nevertheless, we must exercise caution and avoid accidentally colliding with it due to our ship's autopilot, which can be hazardous if not handled carefully!",

What sets it apart is the equatorial canyon that almost appears to divide the planet into two halves. Over the course of a Twin Cycle, the sands of Ash Twin are slowly pulled into this canyon by the irresistible force of gravity, creating a breathtaking sight that must be seen to be believed!",

What's fascinating about this planet is that the sands are in constant motion, being transported back and forth between the twins in a cycle that lasts approximately 45 minutes. But that's not all! Beneath the shimmering sands lies a small core of glittering rock and towering structures of Nomai origin, just waiting to be explored.",

Believe it or not, this planet is almost entirely hollow, with a massive black hole at its core! But that's not all, for there is also a mysterious hanging Nomai city tucked away beneath the crust.

Unfortunately, the only solid ground on this planet consists of small, battered islands that are constantly pummeled by violent tornadoes and thunderstorms.

With the recent development of our Nomai translation tool, we hope to unravel the secrets of this enigmatic structure and uncover its true purpose.",
