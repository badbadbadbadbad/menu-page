This website was built as part of the Odin Project curriculum, specifically, the [Restaurant Page Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page), where the goal was to build a dynamic website only through Javascript DOM manipulation and CSS styling. Additionally, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) was to be used.
